TODOs (BlitJit):
[ ] Converting images from one pixel format to another
    This is likely blitting one image to another using CompositeSrc operation, but
    converting can be also better optimized for some pixel formats.
[ ] Alpha Premultiply / Demultiply (should be used together with converting images)
    This is likely blitting one image to another using CompositeSrc operation
[ ] Currently alpha position in ARGB32_SSE2 generator is hardcoded, fix it.
[ ] Fill span / rect
[ ] Fill span / rect with Mask
[ ] Composite span / rect
[ ] Composite span / rect with Mask
[ ] Colors interpolation
    [ ] Between two colors
    [ ] Need to define structure to be able to interpolate between more colors
        in one function call
[ ] Linear gradient fill with pad / repeat / reflect modes
[ ] Radial gradient fill with pad / repeat / reflect modes
[ ] Conical gradient fill with pad / repeat / reflect modes
