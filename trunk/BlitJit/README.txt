BlitJit - Blit JIT Graphics Library
===================================

http://code.google.com/p/blitjit/

BlitJit is library designed to maximize speed of blit functions.

Examples
========

For examples look at http://code.google.com/p/blitjit/

To build standalone test program in /test directory you need to have AsmJit 
library in directory in one level up:

  ../AsmJit
  ../BlitJit

If you have AsmJit in directory one level up, the cmake project should be
created without problems and test application should run.
